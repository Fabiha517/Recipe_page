🎯 What I learned

I improved my understanding of how to:

Use ::marker to style list bullets and numbers.

Use border-collapse: collapse; in tables.

Apply line-height and padding correctly for vertical spacing.

Create responsive layouts using media queries, especially for 1440px screens.

🔄 Continued development

I want to focus more on improving:

Accessibility features like aria-labels.

Better layout practices using CSS Grid.

Animation or hover effects for interactive elements.
